# GenAI Testing Tutorial - Complete Application

## Overview

This repository is the working codebase and course material for a two-part GenAI testing curriculum.

Part 1 (Exercises 1-4) focuses on RAG testing fundamentals.
Part 2 (Exercises 5-9) focuses on agentic testing for routing, state, reliability, security, and CI gating.

The application is intentionally configured with realistic failure modes so students can practice detection, diagnosis, and mitigation.

## Course Flow

- Student exercises: `docs/exercises/Exercise-1.md` to `docs/exercises/Exercise-9.md`
- Instructor notes: `docs/exercises/Exercise-1-Instructor-Notes.md` to `docs/exercises/Exercise-9-Instructor-Notes.md`
- AppSec demo materials: `docs/appsec-demo/`
- Section transition deck text: `docs/Section-Bridge-RAG-to-Agentic.md`
- Course pacing guide: `docs/Course-Schedule.md`

## Recommended Course Timing

The revised labs are paced so the full course can fit inside roughly **13-14 hours** of class time.

| Exercise | Target Duration |
|---|---|
| Exercise 1 | 35-45 minutes |
| Exercise 2 | 35-45 minutes |
| Exercise 3 | 40-45 minutes |
| Exercise 4 | 45-60 minutes |
| Exercise 5 | 45-50 minutes |
| Exercise 6 | 45-55 minutes |
| Exercise 7 | 40-50 minutes |
| Exercise 8 | 40-50 minutes |
| Exercise 9 | 35-45 minutes |

Exercise-only time is about **6.0 to 7.4 hours**. The remaining course time is intended for lecture, demos, transitions, debriefs, and breaks. See `docs/Course-Schedule.md` for a full recommended agenda.

## Architecture

```
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) → Flask Backend → RAG Pipeline → Cohere API
                                    ↓
                               ChromaDB Vector Store
                                    ↑
                            Knowledge Base Documents
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Cohere API key (get one at https://cohere.com/)
- 2GB+ RAM for vector database
- Windows PowerShell (for Windows users)

### Installation

1. **Clone and Navigate**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\jpayne\Documents\Training\Notebooks for ML classes\TestingAITutorial"
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv training-env
   training-env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # source training-env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
  copy .env.template .env
   # Edit .env and add your Cohere API key
   ```

   Exercise Hub defaults to Student View only. Set `EXERCISE_HUB_ENABLE_INSTRUCTOR=True` in `.env` only for instructor-led sessions.

   Student agentic access is available via `?agent=1`. Exercise pages automatically pass exercise context back to chat for exercise-aware defaults.

5. **Run Application**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

   If you see `ModuleNotFoundError` (for example `flask_cors`), dependencies were not installed in the interpreter you are using. Re-run:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Access Application**
   - Open http://localhost:5000
   - Chat interface should load
   - Try: "What are the key challenges in testing GenAI applications?"
   - Use the bottom **Ask / Agent** toggle in chat to switch modes
   - In Exercise 5-9 flows, Exercise Hub sends `exercise=<n>` so trace/crew defaults can auto-adjust by exercise context

## 🚀 Quick Start (Alternative)

Use the quick launcher:

```bash
python launch.py
```

These provide menu-driven interfaces to:
- Execute regression testing
- Run evaluation framework checks
- Run retrieval tuning support for Exercise 4
- Start the Flask application
- Run Section 7 and 9 automation suites
- Access current exercise documentation

## Course Quick Reference

### Exercise Progression
- Exercises 1-4: RAG testing (goldens, evaluation, diagnostics)
- Section bridge: `docs/Section-Bridge-RAG-to-Agentic.md`
- Exercises 5-9: Agentic testing (routing, trajectories, NFR, red teaming, CI gating)

### Core Scripts
- App: `python run.py`
- Launcher: `python launch.py`
- Section 7 quick-run: `python section7_nfr_quickrun.py`
- Section 9 CI suite: `python section9_agentic_test_suite.py`

### Essential Endpoints
- `GET /` chat UI
- `POST /api/chat` message processing
- `GET /api/health` service health

### Environment Setup
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
- Set `COHERE_API_KEY` in `.env`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Chat Testing
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "What is hallucination in GenAI?"}'
```

### Running Exercise 3 Frameworks
```bash
# Run evaluation framework
python tests/evaluation_framework.py

# Run regression testing framework
python -m regression_testing.regression_testing
```

### Running Exercise 3 in Offline Fixture Mode
If API credentials are unavailable in a classroom environment, run deterministic fixture mode:

```bash
python -m regression_testing.regression_testing --quick --offline
python tests/evaluation_framework.py --offline
```

### Running Exercise 4 Retrieval Tuning Support
```bash
python experiments/retrieval_experiments.py
```

### Running Exercise 7 and 9 Automation
```bash
python section7_nfr_quickrun.py
python section9_agentic_test_suite.py
```

Both scripts support a local in-process fallback transport if Flask dependencies
are unavailable in the current interpreter. This keeps Exercise 7 and 9 artifact
generation runnable in constrained environments.

### Preparing Precomputed Exercise Artifacts
To generate in-repo snapshots for shortened exercises:

```bash
python prepare_exercise_artifacts.py
```

Artifacts are written to `artifacts/precomputed/` for instructor distribution.

### Verifying Exercise Readiness (1-9)
Run structural checks for all exercises:

```bash
python verify_exercise_readiness.py
```

Run with smoke commands enabled:

```bash
python verify_exercise_readiness.py --smoke
```

Reports are written to `artifacts/readiness/` as JSON and Markdown.

### Resetting Agentic State Between Lab Runs
Use the API reset endpoint to clear in-memory session state safely:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/reset \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"scope":"session","session_id":"exercise7-team1","reset_circuit_breaker":true}'
```

Reset all in-memory sessions:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/reset \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"scope":"all","reset_circuit_breaker":true}'
```

### Quality Assessment
```python
from tests.evaluation_framework import EvaluationFramework
from app.rag_pipeline import RAGPipeline

pipeline = RAGPipeline()
evaluator = EvaluationFramework(pipeline)

# Run comprehensive evaluation
results = evaluator.evaluate_response_quality([
    {"query": "What is GenAI testing?", "expected_topics": ["testing", "genai"]}
])

print(f"Average Quality Score: {results['average_quality_score']}")
```

### Regression Testing Integration
```python
from regression_testing.regression_testing import RegressionTestFramework

# Create framework
framework = RegressionTestFramework()

# Run tests programmatically
results = framework.run_regression_tests(save_results=True)

# Check quality gate
gate_passed = (
    results['summary']['pass_rate'] >= 0.8 and 
    results['summary']['critical_failures'] == 0
)

print(f"Quality Gate: {'PASSED' if gate_passed else 'FAILED'}")
```

## Learning Paths

### 🎓 **Beginner Track**
1. Complete student labs in order: Exercise 1 -> 4 (RAG section)
2. Deliver the section bridge before starting Exercise 5
3. Complete Exercise 5 -> 9 (agentic section)
4. Use Section 7 and 9 automation scripts for standardized evidence

### 🔬 **Intermediate Track**  
1. Map each exercise deliverable to one reusable rubric/checklist
2. Add 2-3 custom prompts per exercise to extend coverage
3. Compare baseline and post-change behavior using quick-run artifacts
4. Create a release recommendation from Exercise 9 evidence

### 🚀 **Advanced Track**
1. Extend `section7_nfr_quickrun.py` with additional NFR scenarios
2. Extend `section9_agentic_test_suite.py` with new showstopper gates
3. Integrate suite outputs into CI (artifact upload + gate decision)
4. Add production monitoring and drift checks aligned to Exercise 9

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app' or 'regression_testing'"**
- Ensure commands are run from repository root
- Use the launcher (`python launch.py`) or run `python -m regression_testing.regression_testing`

**"KeyError: 'failed_tests' or 'avg_response_length'"**
- These issues have been FIXED in the test framework
- Test data now includes all required keys for proper execution

**"Import cohere could not be resolved"**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated: `training-env\Scripts\activate`
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Use `python launch.py` to run exercise workflows consistently

**"sentence-transformers not available"**
- This package is optional but recommended for semantic similarity scoring in Exercise 3
- Install with `pip install sentence-transformers` (or `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- If unavailable, the regression framework still runs with reduced semantic checks

**"COHERE_API_KEY not found"**
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
- Add your Cohere API key to the `.env` file

**"ChromaDB initialization failed"**
- Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory
- Delete `data/chroma_db/` folder and restart if corrupted

**"Flask app won't start"**
- Check that port 5000 is available
- Set `FLASK_PORT=5001` in `.env` to use a different port

### Performance Issues

**Slow first response**
- First query initializes the vector database (expected delay)
- Subsequent queries should be faster

**High memory usage**
- ChromaDB loads embeddings into memory
- Reduce document collection size if needed

### Quality Issues

**Poor response quality**
- This may be intentional! Part of the learning exercise
- Check if you're discovering the planted issues correctly

**Off-topic responses**
- Test the system's domain boundaries
- Document cases where it should vs. shouldn't know answers
